### Customer_Churn_Prediction: Predicting and Preventing Customer Attrition

**Description:**  
This project aims to predict customer churn using historical data and identify the key factors contributing to customer attrition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis, the project helps businesses understand the behavioral patterns of customers at risk of leaving and supports the development of strategies to improve customer retention.

**Technologies and Methods Used:**
- **Data Processing & Feature Engineering:** Cleaned and transformed data with tools like **Pandas** and **NumPy** to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations, uncovering insights into customer behavior and identifying churn patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applied algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with **Scikit-learn** to build predictive models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Employed metrics including **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC/AUC** to assess model performance and choose the best model.

**Impact:**
The model identifies customers at a higher risk of churning with significant accuracy, enabling targeted interventions that could improve retention rates. Insights from the feature importance analysis also provide actionable recommendations for the business, such as focusing on customer support, contract renewal, and service quality improvements.

**Key Features:**
- **Customer Data Analysis:** Deep dive into customer profiles, tenure, services, and payment methods to understand churn triggers.
- **Churn Prediction Pipeline:** A robust pipeline that processes raw data, trains predictive models, and evaluates outcomes in a repeatable manner.
- **Insights for Retention Strategies:** Concrete recommendations based on model output to guide retention marketing and operational decisions.
